# Overview of RSE funding calls

This is an [issue-based](https://github.com/DE-RSE/funding_calls/issues) overview of funding options for RSEs and their software.

The funding landscape for researchers is vast, obscure, confusing, and sometimes definitely frustrating. 
All this, except for the first one, is true for people looking for funding for their research software, for RSE work, or related activities.
This repository would like to track upcoming, rolling, and closed funding calls that 
* explicitly target research software engineers, research software engineering, or research software,
* and those where you see a (clear) opportunity to add these aspects in a proposal

If you come across a call that should go here, please use the issue template to submit. 
This will show up as soon as you click on "new issue".
You don't have to stick to the template 100%, but use it as guideline. 
Ideally, indicate the funder using the labels.
We appreciate any hint, be it just a link or lots of details!

In any case, please use English as working language for this repository/for the issues.

Any help is appreciated! In case of questions, get in touch by opening an issue with the label "question".
